## How to add a new book

Move to octobook (single-source reference) - why? why not?



Step 1:  Add a submodule with the book sources (in manuscripts format)

Note: change the name of the repo to start with underscore (`_`)
e.g. `blockchains` becomes `_blockchains`.

```
$ git submodule add --name _blockchains https://github.com/yukimotopress/blockchains _blockchains
```
